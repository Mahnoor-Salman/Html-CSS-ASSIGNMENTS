    <h2>presidential initiative for artificial intelligence and computing</h2>

    <p>Presidential Initiative For Artificial Intelligence And Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded not-for-profit education initiative started by President Of Pakistan ,Dr. Arif Alvi ,Kazi Rahat Ali ,and Zia Khan to help promote education,research and bussiness opportunities in emerging tech fields like<p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cloud Native Computing</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <li>BLock Chain</li>
            <li>Internet Of Things</li>
        </ul>    
    </p>

    <h3>cloud native computing</h3>
    <p>The<b> Cloud Native Computing</b> program prepares the student to program in open source techniologies like<b> Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, Javascript,n Node.js, React Native</b> while introducing the student to devolepment of Microservices and software devolepment techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.</p> 
        
    <h3>artificial intelligence</h3>
    <p> <b> Artificial Intelligence</b> program of PIAIC takes students through the foundation of the AI technology, via teaching programming in open source language like<b>Phython, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</b>strong and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use case endings with re3al-life example of modern Dy AI in practice.</p>

    <h3>block chain</h3>
    <p>The main emphasis of<b> Blockchain</b> program is to understand the blockchain like<b> Etherum and Hyperledger(fabrics),</b> and learn to program in language ,such as Solidity Javascript on framework like Node.JS. t5he program also introduce them to devolepment of Disttributed Apps(DApps), framework like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a-service(BaaS) and how to devolep and offer an Initial Coin Offering(ICO) of a crypto-token.</p>
  
    <h3>internet of thing</h3>
    <p>The <b>Internet Of Things</b> program introduces the students to open souce devolepment technologies like <b> Rust, EmbeddedRust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel,Google Assistant,and Kubernetes</b> while making them efficent in devoloping Micro Services for IoT Edge,IoT Cloud, and voice computing for device control. </p>
